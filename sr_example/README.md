# Shadow Robot Examples (sr_example)

There are several ways to interface with the Shadow Robots. This package provides examples for interfacing through the following methods:

- Utilising a high-level wrapper called the [Robot Commander](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/noetic-devel/sr_robot_commander), which simplifies the interfacing process for those unfamiliar with ROS. Python examples demonstrating use cases for both hand and hand/arm interfaces can be found in the [scripts/robot_commander_examples](scripts/sr_example/robot_commander_examples) folder.
- Direct ROS interfacing in Python is also available, with examples provided in the [scripts/ros_examples](scripts/sr_example/ros_examples) folder. For those preferring C++, examples can be found in the [src](src) folder.

Descriptions of each example can be found within the documentation provided within each script.
