"""
An example that demonstrates how to publish command messages to joints in the hand.
The hand should be launched but the trajectory controllers should
not be running as they overwrite position commands. To check if they are, a call to
rosservice can be made with the following command:
>rosservice call /controller_manager/list_controllers
To stop the trajectory controllers, open the gui (type rqt) and select position control in
plugins > Shadow Robot > Change controllers
