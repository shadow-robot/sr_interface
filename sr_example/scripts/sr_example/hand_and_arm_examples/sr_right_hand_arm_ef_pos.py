# This example demonstrates some of the functions of the arm commander using poses.
# The arm is moved through a sequence of goals generated via different pose functions in the commander.
# A pose can be a PoseStamped message,
# or a list of 6 floats: [x, y, z, rot_x, rot_y, rot_z],
# or a list of 7 floats [x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw]
# PLEASE NOTE: move_to_joint_value_target_unsafe is used in this script, so collision checks
# between the hand and arm are not made!

# For more information, please see:
# https://dexterous-hand.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/2_software_description.html#robot-commander

# roslaunch commands used with this script to launch the robot:
# real robot with a NUC (or a separate computer with an RT kernel):
#     roslaunch sr_robot_launch sr_right_ur10arm_hand.launch
#               external_control_loop:=true sim:=false scene:=true
# simulated robot:
#     roslaunch sr_robot_launch sr_right_ur10arm_hand.launch sim:=true scene:=true

# It is recommended to run this script in simulation first.
