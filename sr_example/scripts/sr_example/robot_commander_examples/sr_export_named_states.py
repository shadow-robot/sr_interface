from sr_robot_commander.sr_robot_state_exporter import SrRobotStateExporter

# The following example shows how to use the warehouse state exporter to save
# robot states from the warehouse as plain text python files. States can be
# extracted one by one, as a list of state names, or all states from a named
# trajectory can be extracted together.

# Once states have been extracted, the resulting dictionary can be exported to
#  a specified file location. The generated file can then be used as a modules
# for importing into subsequent scripts.

# Below is a named trajectory, of the sort used by SrRobotCommander. It is
# assumed that the states "state_1" and "state_2" exist in the warehouse.

trajectory = [
    {
        'name': 'state_1',
        'interpolate_time': 3.0
    },
    {
        'name': 'state_2',
        'interpolate_time': 3.0,
        'pause_time': 2
    }
]

state_exporter = SrRobotStateExporter()

# The following three snippets will produce the same effect, i.e. to extract
# two states, named "state_1" and "state_2"

# Extract one at a time:
state_exporter.extract_one_state("state_1")
state_exporter.extract_one_state("state_2")

# Extract a list:
state_exporter.extract_list(['state_1', 'state_2'])

# Extract all states in a trajectory:
state_exporter.extract_from_trajectory(trajectory)

# Alternatively, you could extract all states from the warehouse:
state_exporter.extract_all()

# Once the states you requrie are extracted, they can be exported to a module:
state_exporter.output_module("/tmp/exported_states.py")
