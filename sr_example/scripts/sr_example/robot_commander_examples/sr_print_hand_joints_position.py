# An example of how to print the current joint positions for all joints.
# Useful when used in conjunction with 'teach mode', as new motion sequences can
# be quickly produced from physically moving the robot into position and then
# recording those positions with this script. Angles can be printed in radians or degrees, an argument should be added
# when the script is called of either 'radians' or 'degrees', default is radians
