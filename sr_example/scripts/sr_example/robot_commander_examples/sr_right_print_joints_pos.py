# An example of how to print the current joint positions of the right arm and hand for all joints.
# be quickly produced from physically moving the robot into position and then
# recording those positions with this script. Angles can be printed in radians or degrees, an argument should be added
# when the script is called of either 'radians' or 'degrees', default is radians

# For more information, please see:
# https://dexterous-hand.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/2_software_description.html#robot-commander

# roslaunch commands used with this script to launch the robot:
# real robot with a NUC (or a separate computer with an RT kernel):
#     roslaunch sr_right_ur10arm_hand.launch external_control_loop:=true sim:=false scene:=true
# simulated robot:
#     roslaunch sr_right_ur10arm_hand.launch sim:=true scene:=true
