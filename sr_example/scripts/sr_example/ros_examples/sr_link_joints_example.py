This example demonstrates how two joints can have their positions 'linked' by
having a child joint subscribing to the parent joint's controller state topic.
The messages are then published to the child joint's controller.

The hand should be launched but the trajectory controllers should
not be running as they overwrite position commands. To check if they are, a call
to rosservice can be made with the following command:
>rosservice call /controller_manager/list_controllers
To stop the trajectory controllers, open the gui (type rqt) and select position control in
plugins > Shadow Robot > Change controllers
NOTE: If the joint sliders plugin is open during this change of controllers, it will
need to be reloaded.

A position can then be published to the parent joint or the joint could be moved by
using the joint sliders in the gui, plugins > Shadow Robot > joint slider

If you move the joint slider for the parent joint, the child joint will move as well.
