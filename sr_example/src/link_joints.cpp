* This example demonstrates how two joints can have their positions 'linked' by
* having a child joint subscribing to the parent joint's controller state topic.
* The messages are then published to the child joint's controller.
*
* The hand should be launched but the trajectory controllers should
* not be running as they overwrite position commands. To check if they are, a call
* to rosservice can be made with the following command:
* >rosservice call /controller_manager/list_controllers
* To stop the trajectory controllers, open the gui (type rqt) and select position control in
* plugins > Shadow Robot > Change controllers
* NOTE: If the joint sliders plugin is open during this change of controllers, it will
* need to be reloaded.
*
* A position can then be published to the parent joint or the joint could be moved by
* using the joint sliders in the gui, plugins > Shadow Robot > joint slider
*
* If you move the joint slider for FFJ3, then MFJ3 will move as well.
