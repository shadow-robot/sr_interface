# sr_moveit_planner_benchmarking

A package to test the different MoveIt planners. Planners currently configured are OMPL, SBPL and STOMP.
Different scenes can be found in the **data/inactive_tests** folder. To include the scene in the benchmarking tests, move the yaml file up a directory level into **data**. The sbpl repository can be found [here](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sandbox) and stomp [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/industrial_moveit). You'll need to include them in your workspace.

# Launch

To run all the benchmarkings, simply launch a roscore and run:

```
rosrun sr_moveit_planner_benchmarking benchmark_planners.py _data:=`rospack find sr_moveit_planner_benchmarking`/data _results:=/tmp
```
To visualise the tests in Rviz, set the visualisation argument in launch/benchmarking.launch to 'True'.

# Configuration

Currently the configurations for SBPL and STOMP are not generated automatically as OMPL is. The argument
'generate_planning_config' in [planning_pipeline.launch.xml](https://github.com/shadow-robot/sr_interface/tree/indigo-devel/sr_multi_moveit/sr_multi_moveit_config/launch/planning_pipeline.launch.xml) is set to True by default but is set to false for the sbpl and stomp tests.

Different tweaks can be made in the scene yaml files. The first is the number of planning attempts for each goal and the second being the planning library name. The STOMP config has been edited to meet the  [suggestions](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/swri-ros-pkg-dev/sNvFmkQsMtg/mGPrXDy8EwAJ), but probably needs more tweaks.

# Notes
ARA* planner in sbpl currently causes movegroup to crash during the 2nd planning request.
The point cloud for collision_scene_2 is generated from two rosbags of pointcloud data,
office_scene.bag and office_scene_2.bag, [here](data/).
