# ***DISCLAIMER***
# This script provides a command line interface to save the current pose of the robot (made of an arm and hand).
# Poses can be composed of either hand joints/arm joints/all joints. This can be useful for making smooth
# movements where the hand and arm should move synchronously. However, there are no safeties! In particular,
# if a hand and arm aren't both present , its behaviour is undefined. Likewise if more than one hand/arm are
# present. There is also no checking to prevent overwriting existing database entries/otherwise damaging the
# robot_states database. It is included here as it is a useful tool, but it should be considered a work in
# progress and used with care.
#
# You have been warned :)
#
# To use this script:
#
# rosrun sr_robot_commander grasp_saver_unsafe.py NAME_TO_SAVE WHAT_TO_SAVE
#
# NAME_TO_SAVE is the name that will be used for the state in the database.
#
# N.B. IF A STATE ALREADY EXISTS WITH THAT NAME IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN WITH NO WARNING!
#
# WHAT_TO_SAVE specifies which joints will be included. It can be "arm","hand" or "both".
#
# If WHAT_TO_SAVE is omitted, it defaults to "both".
