***DISCLAIMER***

This script provides a command line interface to save the current pose of the robot (made of an arm and hand).
Poses can be composed of either hand joints/arm joints/all joints. This can be useful for making smooth
movements where the hand and arm should move synchronously. However, there are no safeties! In particular,
if a hand and arm aren't both present , its behaviour is undefined. Likewise if more than one hand/arm are
present. There is also no checking to prevent overwriting existing database entries/otherwise damaging the
robot_states database. It is included here as it is a useful tool, but it should be considered a work in
progress and used with care.

You have been warned :)


To use this script:

rosrun sr_robot_commander grasp_saver_unsafe.py NAME_TO_SAVE WHAT_TO_SAVE

NAME_TO_SAVE is the name that will be used for the state in the database.

N.B. IF A STATE ALREADY EXISTS WITH THAT NAME IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN WITH NO WARNING!

WHAT_TO_SAVE specifies which joints will be included. It can be "arm","hand" or "both".

If WHAT_TO_SAVE is omitted, it defaults to "both".
