# This script provides a command line interface to combine arm joints from one robot_state with hand joints from
# another robot_state. States are identified using their name in the DB
# To use this script:
# rosrun sr_robot_commander combine_robot_state ARM_STATE_NAME HAND_STATE_NAME NAME_TO_SAVE
# NAME_TO_SAVE is the name that will be used for the state in the database.
# N.B. IF A STATE ALREADY EXISTS WITH THAT NAME IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN WITH NO WARNING!
# ARM_STATE_NAME specifies the name of the state from which the arm joints have to be read
# HAND_STATE_NAME specifies the name of the state from which the hand joints have to be read
# If you don't want to use one of the two arm or hand, you can replace .
